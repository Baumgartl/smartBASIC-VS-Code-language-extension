# SmartBASIC Language Extension for Visual Studio Code

A Visual Studio Code extension with syntax highlighting for Laird Connectivity's SmartBASIC language.

## SmartBASIC

Laird Connectivityâ€™s smartBASIC is an event-driven programming language that was designed to make BLE technology development quicker and simpler, vastly cutting down time to market. A simple smartBASIC application encapsulates the complete end-to-end process of reading, writing, and processing sensor data as well as advertising, connecting, security, power management, and wireless status. See https://www.lairdconnect.com/wireless-modules/bluetooth-modules for more information.

## Language Extension

### Syntax Highlighting

Laird provides syntax highlighting files for Notepad++ (Windows) and Textpad (Mac OSX) along with their regular module firmware versiosn releases. This VS Code language extension is based on the latest Notepad++ syntax files for BL652, BL653 and BL654. Other than the original syntax files from Laird, which cover only the language scope of each module's SmartBASIC implementation, this language extension is a superset of these scopes.

The drawback of this implementation is, that when working on e.g. a BL652 module, VS Code would also highlight SmartBASIC functions, which are only available on the higher-end BL653 or BL654 modules. The advantage is, that you only need one syntax file and no need to switch syntax files when working with different modules in parallel.

### Snippets

Snippets were contributed by [cvanbeek13](https://github.com/cvanbeek13). To add a snippet, start typing the snippet prefix. VS Code will list it as an auto-fill option:

Clicking enter on the snippet will insert it. You then can fill out the fields, clicking tab after each to fill in additional data (such as name, args, and return_val here).

### Code Folding

[cvanbeek13](https://github.com/cvanbeek13) also contributed code folding, so you can collapse sections/blocks of code. E.g. a for loop:

gets collapsed like this:

## File Recognition

SmartBASIC files are usually given names with suffix .sb or .sblib. This language extension recognizes both.

## Manual Installation
